## Pre-Interview

* Familiarise yourself with the project and `git clone` into a local working directory
* Ensure you have docker installed and you can run `docker run hello-world`

## Interview Questions

1. Build the docker images and run the applications
    * Hint: Should only require `docker compose`
    * Hint: The service is running on `localhost:8888`, unless changes are made to `docker-compose.yml`
2. Create a request to obtain the list of users (any language)
3. Obtain list of items for a user and iterate over, presenting the panel each item.

## Dummy Service

If you list docker containers `docker container ls` after `docker compose`, you will note the dummy service.

This service will exit after creating dummy data and can be ignored.
